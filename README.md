# PCF Mobile Services Data Client SDK Samples for Android


## Data SDK Usage

For more information please visit the [docs site](http://docs.pivotal.io/mobile/data/android/).


## Data Demo Application

The Data Demo Application is an example of the simplest application possible that uses the PCF Mobile Services Data Client SDK.  At this time, it only demonstrates how to authenticate the user, and persist, retrieve and delete a value for a single key.

You can specify your own environment details by editing the values in the sample project's `pivotal.properties` resource file.

Watch the log output in the sample application's display to see what the Data SDK is doing in the background.  This log output should also be visible in the Android device log (for debug builds).
